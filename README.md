# employee-management-system-backend

This is the backend service for the Employee Management System, built using Spring Boot and MySQL.
It provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing employee data — including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employees.
The backend follows a layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) for better scalability and maintainability.
